# To debug this command parser, run the following command as the zenoss user:
# zencommand run -v10 --showfullcommand --showrawresults --device=<device_id>

# As a ZenPack developer, when specifying the command to run on the command-line,
# a "$" must be entered as "$$". If you type "$$", bash will see "$". If this is
# not done, an event will appear in Zenoss UI containing a traceback due to the
# TALES parser failing. Note that this event will be in the global event queue
# and will not be associated with the device that is being monitored.

# Also note that if you fix a command parser in the UI (ie. change "$" to "$$"),
# you will need to re-export the ZenPack to have the changes reflected in your
# git repo. And Zenoss only parses objects.xml when it installs ZenPacks, or when
# you update the ZenPack via the UI. So if you fix objects.xml on one machine,
# then pull the changes on to another machine, you will need to uninstall and
# reinstall the ZenPack for the command changes to take effect.
