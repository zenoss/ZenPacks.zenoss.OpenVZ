        # datapoint which in turn is then pased to processResults(), below. The
        # data we are stuffing in the datapoint is container status information
        # for all existing containters. This is the current status known by
        # Zenoss that is stored in each container component. We pass this along
        # so that we can later see the previous status, when reading in new
        # status. And then we can figure out if we need to send an event -- if
        # that status has changed.

        # This trick is needed because processResults() is run by zencommand
        # and does not have direct access to the model.

                # We are not explicitly setting an event class here, so it will default to
                # /Unknown. This means that the event will not be immutably locked into an
                # event class and we can then use a mapping to control everything about it.
                # This allows us to place it in the event class that we want and and attach
                # a transform to this specific type of event, based on eventClassKey. The
                # transform allows us to execute python code to perform actions based on 
                # information in the event.

                # We create event mappings in the UI, by selecting the Event and clicking on
                # the little "tree" icon, or this can be done without selecting an Event by
                # going to "Event Classes" , "Status" (for example), and at bottom of screen
                # "Event Class Mappings", you can add one here. Make sure "eventClassKey"
                # matches the "eventClassKey" set below in the code. This will place that
                # event into the /Status event class.

                # Also make sure to add the Event Mapping to the ZenPack by selecting its
                # link and going to "Add to ZenPack".

                # We can map Events based on eventClassKey. Then, there is a rule and regex
                # that can be used to make our event mapping even more specific.

                # The "rule" is a python expression. True = match; False = no match
                # The "regex" will be matched against the event's message field, which is
                # usually a copy of "summary" that hasn't been truncated. Match = match.

                # The "transform" is literal python code.
                # globals in the context of the code that executes in "transform" are:
                #
                # evt (Event Object)
                # device & dev (Device Object - may be None)

                # log (logger that will output into zeneventd.log)

                # IInfo (Info adapter interface - for convenience)
                #
                # Example code:
                # 
                # if component:
                #     # modify properties of the object directly...
                #     component.container_status = evt.new_status
                #     txnCommit()
                #
                # This will update the status of the component with which the event is
                # associated, and commit the new status information to the model.
                #
                # In this code, we are making direct changes to the model, which give us
