# This modeler plugin can be tested on an OpenVZ host by running:
# zenmodel run -v10 --device="10.0.1.2"
#
# This modeler plugin is also imported by zenhub, so you should check zenhub.log for any tracebacks if your
# modeler plugin does not appear to be working.

    # These values tell zenhub how to check and potentially update our object heirarchy to reflect new changes to
    # devices. We define various values that zenhub uses to look at the right place in the object heirarchy, create
    # the right kinds of objects, and connect to the right relationships in our objects. These values are akin
    # to an "address" on an envelope that allows zenhub to get the relMap/objectMaps we return to the right location.

    # The values up here are static values that are used by helper functions self.relMap() and self.objectMap(), to
    # set corresponding internal values in the objects returned. We can also import relMap and objectMap and manually
    # create these objects ourselves, and set relname, modname, compname, classname ourselves, and this is often
    # required in more advanced scenarios.

    # relname is a relationship name, which is the same as the relationship name in the model class:
    relname = "openvz_containers"
    # this is the class we will instantiate... and it needs to match the container
    modname = "ZenPacks.zenoss.OpenVZ.Container"
    # we could also set compname up here if we wanted....
    # compname is used to hang things off of "os/" instead of off the device directly...
    # compname is anything we want to insert after our device but before our relationship, and can contain slashes....
    # the heirarchy of device/os/foo/bar MUST already exist and be created somewhere else.
    # device/os/interfaces/eth0
    #        ^^ ^^^^^^^^^^   ^^ 
    # device/os/interfaces/eth0/ips/foo
    #        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^ ^^^
    # above, first set of ^ is compname, second set is relname, third set is ID. See how compname changes length, relname
    # is always the last part before the ID........
    # classname will be set to "ZenPacks.zenoss.OpenVZ.Container.Container", auto-calculated based on modname (dup last name)
