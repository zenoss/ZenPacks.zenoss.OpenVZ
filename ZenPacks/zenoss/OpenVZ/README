WIP: THIS ZENPACK IS A WORK IN PROGRESS, NOT YET DONE! (BUT WORKS AS OF THIS COMMIT)

To install ZenPacks, there is only one daemon that needs to be running: zeneventserver.

Best practice is to install ZenPacks:

$ zenoss stop
$ zeneventserver start
$ zenpack --install foo.egg
$ zenoss start

For 3.x, use zeoctl instead of zeneventserver.
